2024 was a great year for NEAR – we saw major growth across all metrics, welcomed the return of [NEAR.AI](https://near.ai), and progressed towards Web3 truly multichain with Chain Abstraction. Thank you for all your support and feedback throughout the year! Here’s a recap of everything our teams accomplished and a look ahead at what we’ll work on in 2025.

## Major Growth Across All Metrics & Notable Launches

NEAR is a top protocol for real-world apps with millions of users and is the top L1 by user retention. The NEAR network has never experienced an outage, even during major live protocol updates. Here are some growth highlights (with numbers from [Dune](https://dune.com/near/chain-abstraction-is-near) and [Artemis](https://app.artemisanalytics.com/chains)):

- **40 million** monthly active users, up from 7 million last year
- **4 million** daily active users, a 4x increase this year
- **8+ million** daily transactions, doubled from the start of the year (with average fee at $0.002)
- **Top 4 apps in Web3 by monthly active users:**
  - KAIKAI: 31.7 million MAU
  - HOT Wallet: 4.2 million MAU
  - SWEAT: 1.6 million MAU
  - Playember: 500k MAU
- **$700 million** in stablecoins flowed into the NEAR ecosystem, a 20x increase YoY
- New ATH in natively issued stablecoins in May at **$760 million**, with a 5x increase in DeFi TVL from $88 million to $430 million
- NEAR ecosystem teams raised **$146 million** in external capital in 2024
- **Nightshade 2.0** launched: 6 shards live (50% capacity increase), with 8 shards coming in Q1 2025. Introduced [Stateless Validation](https://pages.near.org/blog/nightshade-2-launches-on-near-mainnet-introducing-stateless-validation/).
- Ran 3 successful accelerator cohorts (2 for AI, 1 for Chain Abstraction), with $50.5 million raised by participants
- Full [MetaMask](https://pages.near.org/blog/ethereum-near-mainnet/) and ETH wallet compatibility
- Hosted [REDACTED]: NEAR’s annual flagship conference in Bangkok, with 1200 attendees, 1600 hackers, and 6300+ transactions on the conference app

## NEAR is the Blockchain for AI

The entire internet is shifting toward AI + blockchain, and NEAR is positioned to lead this AI-first future. Our goal: ensure AI is open source, preserves user privacy, and supports sovereignty while remaining sustainable for builders.

Key milestones:

- In May, the NEAR Foundation announced its focus on **User-Owned AI** with co-founder Alex Skidanov leading R&D.
- At [REDACTED] in November, we launched **NEAR AI** in Alpha:
  - [app.near.ai](http://app.near.ai): A research hub building a 1.4T parameter model in an open way
  - [chat.near.ai](http://chat.near.ai): A user-owned AI assistant that can act across Web2 and Web3
- The NEAR AI ecosystem now includes more than **50 top AI teams** across research, infrastructure, data, models, and applications.

A core part of this vision is making blockchain elements invisible to users, powered by agent-driven experiences:

- [Chain Signatures](https://near.org/chain-abstraction): Enable smart contracts to sign transactions on any blockchain. Live across mainnets using ECDSA, with EdDSA coming soon.
- [Intents](https://pages.near.org/blog/introducing-near-intents/): New transaction type allowing AI agents, users, and services to exchange requests and actions across Web2 and Web3. Try the [Demo Intents app](https://app.near-intents.org/).
- [Infinex](https://pages.near.org/blog/infinex-integrates-near-protocol-chain-signatures-and-near-intents/): Partnership to integrate Chain Signatures and NEAR Intents into the Infinex DeFi platform.

## What’s Next?

We are moving full speed ahead in January:

- Building an ecosystem for autonomous agents
- Enabling agentic commerce
- Developing TEE infrastructure for verifiably private AI inference
- Hosting monetizable models

Momentum is already starting:

- [Eliza](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/847) running multichain swaps using NEAR intents
- Collaboration between NEAR AI and [Frax Finance](https://twitter.com/fraxfinance/status/1868837636577874264) to build autonomous agents
- SWEAT integrating an AI assistant into its wallet UI

**2025 is the year of Blockchain for AI.**

This focus ensures that the future internet is owned by more than a few corporations and supports user sovereignty. Everything we build in 2025 will align with this mission and help founders and builders join us.

Thank you to the entire NEAR community for your incredible work and commitment this year.

– Illia
