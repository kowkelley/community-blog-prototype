It’s getting really real: **[REDACTED]** is just around the corner, and we have some major updates.

You may recall that [**[REDACTED]**](https://redactedbangkok.ai/) is a global convergence to shape the future of User-Owned AI and Chain Abstraction—a future where technology belongs to the people, not corporations.

It’s an IRL movement gathering November 9-11 in Bangkok. It’s a worldwide hackathon kicking off September 5. It’s a defining moment to unify the collective working on these technologies to reclaim our sovereignty.

_Are you in?_

## The IRL movement: Speakers announced, apply to attend

**[REDACTED]** is a full IRL movement: 1,500+ developers, builders, founders, funders, researchers, regulators, and more gathering in person, November 9–11, at the Avani+ Riverside Hotel in Bangkok.

Some things can only happen IRL, and some are just way better, like:

- Gaining insights from the teams defining the intersection of AI and Web3
- Upskilling and learning how to develop AI x Web3 products and apps
- Forming deep connections to build the user-owned future together

**[REDACTED]** will feature curated sessions, workshops, and discussions led by the pioneers of AI x Web3 and Chain Abstraction. Speakers include:

- Illia Polosukhin (NEAR)
- Curtis Spencer (Electric Capital)
- Anand Iyer (Canonical)
- Maartje Bus (Messari)
- Matt Stephenson (Pantera)
- Calanthia Mei (Masa)
- Evrard-Nil Daillet (Google)

And more to come as we get closer to Bangkok.

**Tickets are totally free**—you just have to [apply to attend](https://redactedbangkok.ai/), either as a participant or a hacker. Visa letters are available to support visa applications.
